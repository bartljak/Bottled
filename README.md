Introduction
------------

This is an E2EE iOS messaging app created for Software Design and Documentation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
The app allows users to create an account, sign in(with password, PIN, or FaceID). After a user is logged in, they can 
send a message to any registered user by typing in their username and a message in the New Message view. Contacts
are stored locally on the device, and messages are encrypted and stored on the server. 

Pre-requisites
--------------

- iOS 12
- An iOS device registered to our Developer account

Getting Started

Please contact us if you would like your device ID to be added to our account so you can try out the app.
